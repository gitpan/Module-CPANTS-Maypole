NAME
    Module::CPANTS::Maypole - Web interface to the CPANTS database using
    Maypole

Description
     The database schema used now is not fully supported by SQL::Parser hence we had to
     changed the schema a bit. This is being done in the db/clean.pl script.

     To access the database visit L<http://cpants.szabgab.com/>
 
     This code is being released to CPAN mainly so that other people can look at it, 
     comment on it and send patches.
